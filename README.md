# Matrix-in-Assembly

This interesting little program creates the famous "rain code" from The Matrix in Mips Assembly. Getting it up and running requires Mars to be installed along with a terminal plugin (terminal.zip).

The user is allowed to choose between 1 and 80 different "lines" of raid code which will increase with speed.
